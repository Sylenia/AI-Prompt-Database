## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Backend
- **Language**: Node.js with TypeScript (team familiarity)
- **Framework**: Express.js with Fastify for high-performance services
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket connections
- **Message Queue**: Redis for pub/sub and job queues
- **Video**: WebRTC with Kurento Media Server for large calls

### Database
- **Primary**: PostgreSQL for structured data (users, teams, projects)
- **Cache**: Redis for sessions, real-time data, and message caching
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or MinIO for file uploads
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for message search functionality

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for complex state
- **Real-time**: Socket.io client
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Ant Design for rapid development

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose for development
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for production (or start with simple VPS)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

## Detailed Component Design

### 1. Message Service
```typescript
interface MessageService {
  sendMessage(channelId: string, message: MessagePayload): Promise<void>
  getChannelHistory(channelId: string, limit: number): Promise<Message[]>
  subscribeToChannel(channelId: string, userId: string): void
}
```

- Real-time message delivery via Socket.io
- Message persistence in PostgreSQL
- Redis for message caching and pub/sub

### 2. User Service

```typescript
interface UserService {
  authenticate(credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<AuthResult>
  createUser(userData: CreateUserRequest): Promise<User>
  updateUserStatus(userId: string, status: UserStatus): Promise<void>
}
```

- JWT-based authentication
- User management and team assignments
- Integration with external OAuth providers

### 3. File Service

- Secure file upload with virus scanning
- Progressive upload for large files
- Automatic thumbnail generation for images
- CDN integration for fast delivery

### 4. Video Service

- WebRTC peer-to-peer for small calls (<5 people)
- Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) for larger calls
- Recording capabilities with cloud storage
- Screen sharing support

## Scalability Strategy

### Phase 1 (MVP): Monolithic Start

- Single Node.js application
- PostgreSQL primary database
- Redis for caching
- Supports up to 1,000 concurrent users

### Phase 2 (Growth): Service Separation

- Extract message service for independent scaling
- Add read replicas for database
- Implement horizontal scaling for video services
- CDN for static assets

### Phase 3 (Scale): Full Microservices

- Complete service decomposition
- Database sharding by team/organization
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced caching strategies

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

```md
User → API Gateway → JWT Validation → Service Authorization
```

- JWT tokens with short expiry (15 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting per user/IP

### Data Protection

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive messages
- At-rest encryption for database and files
- HTTPS everywhere with HSTS headers
- Input validation and sanitization

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Core MVP

**Goal**: Basic messaging and user management

- User authentication and team creation
- Real-time messaging in channels
- Basic file sharing
- Simple web client

**MVP Features:**

- Login/signup
- Create teams and channels
- Send/receive messages
- Upload/download files

### Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Enhanced Features

- Video calling (up to 10 participants)
- Message search
- Mobile-responsive design
- Basic project management features

### Phase 3 (Months 5-6): Production Ready

- Advanced video features (screen sharing, recording)
- Full project management integration
- Admin dashboard
- Comprehensive security features

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Start with proven technologies
   - Build comprehensive testing early
   - Plan for database migration strategies

2. **Scalability Risks**:
   - Design with microservices in mind from day 1
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
   - Monitor performance metrics continuously

3. **Security Risks**:
   - Regular security audits
   - Implement logging and monitoring
   - Have incident response plan ready

## Success Metrics

- Message delivery latency <200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Support 10,000 concurrent users
- File upload success rate >99%
- Video call quality metrics

## Variations
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Focus on enterprise patterns and governance
- **Microservices Design**: Deep dive into service decomposition
- **Cloud-Native**: Emphasize cloud services and serverless architectures
- **Legacy Migration**: Focus on modernizing existing systems

## Tips
- Be specific about scale and performance requirements
- Include budget and timeline constraints for realistic recommendations
- Mention team expertise to align technology choices
- Consider starting simple and evolving the architecture over time
- Always include security and compliance considerations
