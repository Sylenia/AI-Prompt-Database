## Comprehensive Pomodoro Timer App

Create a comprehensive pomodoro timer app using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript following the time management technique. Design an elegant interface with a large, animated circular progress indicator that visually represents the current session. Allow customization of work intervals (default 25min), short breaks (default 5min), and long breaks (default 15min). Include a task list integration where users can associate pomodoro sessions with specific tasks. Add configurable sound notifications for interval transitions with volume control. Implement detailed statistics tracking daily/weekly productivity with visual charts. Use localStorage to persist settings and history between sessions. Make the app installable as a PWA with offline support and notifications. Add keyboard shortcuts for quick timer control (start/pause/reset). Include multiple theme options with customizable colors and fonts. Add a focus mode that blocks distractions during work intervals.
