## Web Based Music Player

Develop a web-based music player using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with the Web Audio API. Create a modern interface with album art display and visualizations. Implement playlist management with drag-and-drop reordering. Add audio controls including play/pause, skip, seek, volume, and playback speed. Include shuffle and repeat modes with visual indicators. Support multiple audio formats with fallbacks. Implement a 10-band equalizer with presets. Add metadata extraction and display from audio files. Create a responsive design that works on all devices. Include keyboard shortcuts for playback control. Support background playback with media session API integration.
