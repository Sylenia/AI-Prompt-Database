## Developer Focused Code Snippet Manager

Build a developer-focused code snippet manager using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Create a clean IDE-like interface with syntax highlighting for 30+ programming languages. Implement a tagging and categorization system for organizing snippets. Add a powerful search function with support for regex and filtering by language/tags. Include code editing with line numbers, indentation guides, and bracket matching. Support public/private visibility settings for each snippet. Implement export/import functionality in JSON and Gist formats. Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations. Create a responsive design that works well on all devices. Include automatic saving with version history. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality with syntax formatting preservation.
