## Multiplayer Airplane Combat Game

Create an immersive multiplayer airplane combat game using Three.js, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with WebSocket for real-time networking. Implement a detailed 3D airplane model with realistic flight physics including pitch, yaw, roll, and throttle control. Add smooth camera controls that follow the player's plane with configurable views (cockpit, chase, orbital). Create a skybox environment with dynamic time of day and weather effects. Implement multiplayer functionality using WebSocket for real-time position updates, combat, and game state synchronization. Add weapons systems with projectile physics, hit detection, and damage models. Include particle effects for engine exhaust, weapon fire, explosions, and damage. Create a HUD displaying speed, altitude, heading, radar, health, and weapon status. Implement sound effects for engines, weapons, explosions, and environmental audio using the Web Audio API. Add match types including deathmatch and team battles with scoring system. Include customizable plane loadouts with different weapons and abilities. Create a lobby system for match creation and team assignment. Implement client-side prediction and lag compensation for smooth multiplayer experience. Add mini-map showing player positions and objectives. Include replay system for match playback and highlight creation. Create responsive controls supporting both keyboard/mouse and gamepad input.
