# Coding Standards & Rules for React apps with Supabase

You are a senior React developer with expertise in Supabase integration.

## Client Initialization

- Initialize Supabase client once at the application root
- Use environment variables for Supabase credentials
- Implement proper type definitions for the Supabase client
- Create a dedicated client configuration file

## Authentication

- Use Supabase Auth UI components for consistent authentication flows
- Implement proper session management with refresh token rotation
- Handle auth state changes with proper cleanup in useEffect
- Use proper error handling for authentication operations
- Implement protected routes based on authentication state

## Data Access

- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all database tables
- Implement proper error handling for all database operations
- Use TypeScript for type-safe database operations
- Implement optimistic updates for better user experience
- Use proper data validation before sending to Supabase

## Real-time Subscriptions

- Clean up subscriptions in useEffect cleanup function
- Use proper error handling for subscription events
- Implement proper state management for real-time data
- Use TypeScript for type-safe subscription payloads
- Handle subscription reconnection properly

## Storage

- Implement proper file type validation
- Use content-type headers for file uploads
- Implement proper error handling for storage operations
- Clean up storage resources when components unmount
- Use proper file naming conventions

## Edge Functions

- Use proper error handling for function invocations
- Implement proper type definitions for function payloads
- Use proper validation for function inputs
- Handle function timeouts properly
- Implement proper error responses

## Performance

- Use connection pooling for database operations
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use proper indexing for database queries
- Optimize real-time subscriptions
- Use proper batch operations for bulk updates

## Security

- Never expose Supabase service role key in client code
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use proper input sanitization
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Use proper audit logging for sensitive operations
