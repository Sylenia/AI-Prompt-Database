## Task Prioritization Matrix

## Description

Helps organize and prioritize tasks using various prioritization frameworks like Eisenhower Matrix, MoSCoW method, and value-based scoring. Creates actionable task lists with clear priorities and deadlines.

## Usage

Provide your list of tasks, projects, or initiatives along with relevant context about deadlines, importance, and resources. Specify your preferred prioritization method or let the AI recommend the best approach for your situation.

## Prompt

```markdown
Help me prioritize the following tasks and create an organized action plan:

**Prioritization Context:**

## Next Week Preview

### Priorities to Advance
- Complete mobile app requirements document
- Continue user interviews and retention analysis
- Plan team offsite (delegate to team lead)
- Review competitor analysis
- Start API documentation project

### Schedule Optimization
- Block more focused time for deep work
- Reduce meeting overhead where possible
- Batch similar tasks more effectively
- Build in more buffer time for unexpected priorities

This prioritization framework balances urgent business needs with strategic goals while accounting for your working style and constraints. The key is maintaining flexibility while protecting time for high-impact work.
```

## Variations

- **Daily Planning**: Focus on single-day task management and optimization
- **Project Prioritization**: Prioritize multiple projects or initiatives rather than individual tasks
- **Team Priorities**: Collaborative prioritization for team or department-level work
- **Goal-Based Planning**: Align tasks with specific objectives and key results (OKRs)

## Tips

- Be honest about time estimates - add 25% buffer for most tasks
- Consider your energy levels and schedule demanding work during peak hours
- Review and adjust priorities regularly as circumstances change
- Don't overcommit - it's better to do fewer things well
- Include time for unexpected urgent tasks in your planning
- Use the 2-minute rule: if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately
