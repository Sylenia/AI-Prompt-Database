Dear [Client Name],

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for taking the time last Tuesday to attend our project management software demonstration with your team.

I wanted to follow up on the excellent questions you raised during our session, particularly regarding data migration and pricing for your 15-person team.

**Regarding Data Migration:**
I've spoken with our technical team, and we can provide a complimentary data migration service from your current system. Our migration specialists will work directly with your IT team to ensure a seamless transition with zero data loss.

**Pricing for Your Team:**
For a 15-user license, our annual plan would be $1,800/year (that's $10/user/month), which includes:
- Full platform access
- Priority customer support
- Free data migration
- Monthly training sessions

**Next Steps:**
I'd love to offer you a 30-day free trial so your team can experience the platform firsthand. Would you be available for a brief 15-minute call this week to discuss implementation timeline and answer any remaining questions?

I'm available Tuesday-Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. Please let me know what works best for your schedule.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
Sales Manager  
TechSolutions Inc.
