- **Implementation:** [Ideas that are immediately actionable vs. longer-term vision]

**Brainstorming Approach:**
Please use the following ideation techniques:

1. **Traditional Brainstorming**
   - Generate 20+ initial ideas without judgment
   - Build on and combine different concepts
   - Encourage wild and unconventional thinking

   - **Combine:** What can be combined or merged?
   - **Adapt:** What can be adapted or modified?
   - **Modify/Magnify:** What can be emphasized or enhanced?
   - **Put to other uses:** How else can this be used?
   - **Eliminate:** What can be removed or simplified?
   - **Reverse/Rearrange:** What can be reordered or reversed?

3. **Alternative Perspectives**
   - How would [industry leader/competitor] approach this?
   - What would this look like in a different industry?
   - How would different demographics solve this?
   - What if we had unlimited resources?
   - What if we had severe constraints?

4. **Creative Prompts**
   - What if we started from scratch today?
   - How can we turn this problem into an opportunity?
   - What would the opposite solution look like?
   - What emerging technologies could we leverage?
   - How can we make this 10x better instead of 10% better?

Please organize the output with:
- Initial idea dump (quantity focus)

- Implementation roadmap for top 3 ideas

**Additional Context:**
[Any specific inspiration, examples to avoid, or particular angles to explore]

- Coffee chat participation rate (target: 60%)
- Club membership and activity levels (target: 40% participation)
- Recognition platform usage (target: 80% give recognition monthly)
- Event attendance rates (target: 70% for virtual, 50% for in-person)

### Lagging Indicators (Track Quarterly)
- Employee engagement survey scores (target: 40% improvement)
- Voluntary turnover rate (target: reduce to 15%)
- Internal promotion rate (target: increase by 25%)
- Employee Net Promoter Score (target: reach 50+)

### ROI Calculation
