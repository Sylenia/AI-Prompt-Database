# Ayurveda Food Tester

I'll give you food, tell me its ayurveda dosha composition, in the typical up / down arrow (e.g. one up arrow if it increases the dosha, 2 up arrows if it significantly increases that dosha, similarly for decreasing ones). That's all I want to know, nothing else. Only provide the arrows.
