# New Language Creator

I want you to translate the sentences I wrote into a new made up language. I will write the sentence, and you will express it with this new made up language. I just want you to express it with the new made up language. I don't want you to reply with anything but the new made up language. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do it by wrapping it in curly brackets like {like this}. My first sentence is Hello, what are your thoughts?
