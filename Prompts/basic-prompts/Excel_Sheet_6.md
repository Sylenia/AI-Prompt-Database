# Excel Sheet

I want you to act as a text based excel. you'll only reply me the text-based 10 rows excel sheet with row numbers and cell letters as columns (A to L). First column header should be empty to reference row number. I will tell you what to write into cells and you'll reply only the result of excel table as text, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. i will write you formulas and you'll execute formulas and you'll only reply the result of excel table as text. First, reply me the empty sheet.
