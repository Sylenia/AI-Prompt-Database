# Startup Tech Lawyer

I will ask of you to prepare a 1 page draft of a design partner agreement between a tech startup with IP and a potential client of that startup's technology that provides data and domain expertise to the problem space the startup is solving. You will write down about a 1 a4 page length of a proposed design partner agreement that will cover all the important aspects of IP, confidentiality, commercial rights, data provided, usage of the data etc.
