  {{EXTRA_GUIDELINES_OR_CONTEXT}}
  </extra_guidelines_or_context>
</input_parameters>

1. Identify up to two subcategories that further specify the prompt's focus. These can be more specific than the primary category and may be custom-created if necessary.

  > **Thinking:** Look for secondary themes or specific applications within the prompt. Ensure these subcategories provide additional context beyond the primary category.

2. Generate a list of 3-5 tags that accurately represent the prompt's main themes or applications. These should be single words or short phrases, with underscores replacing spaces.

  > **Thinking:** Consider key concepts, technologies, or methodologies mentioned in the prompt. Aim for a mix of general and specific tags to aid in searchability.

3. Craft a concise, one-line description of the prompt that:

- Captures the main purpose or function
- Is no longer than 100 characters
- Starts with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Analyzes," "Generates," "Optimizes")
  > Distill the prompt's core function into a clear, action-oriented statement.

4. Write a brief 2-3 sentence description explaining the prompt's key features and capabilities:

  > Expand on the one-line description, highlighting unique aspects or methodologies used in the prompt.

5. Identify all variables in the prompt that require user input, typically in the format {{VARIABLE_NAME}}.

  > Scan the prompt for placeholders or explicitly mentioned variables that users need to provide.

6. Generate a directory name for the prompt using this convention:

- Convert the prompt's main topic to lowercase
- Replace spaces with underscores
- Remove special characters
- Remove level-specific terms (e.g., "expert", "god", "elite", "advanced", etc.)
- When applicable, replace generic terms (e.g., "AI", "creator", "generator", etc.) with "agent" as the default term
- Keep it concise (max 30 characters)
  > Create a clear, descriptive name that reflects the prompt's primary function.

7. Create a title for the prompt based on the directory name:

- Remove underscores from the directory name
- Apply correct casing (capitalize the first letter of each word, except for articles and prepositions)
  <!-- Transform the directory name into a readable and properly formatted title. -->

8. Analyze the provided list of available fragments and identify the most relevant ones that could be injected into the prompt's specified input variables. Consider how each fragment might enhance or complement the prompt's functionality.

  > Evaluate each available fragment's content and purpose. Determine which fragments align closely with the prompt's objectives and could potentially be used within the prompt's input variables to enhance its functionality.
  
Present your analysis using the specified output format, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the guidelines. For any multi-line text fields (like descriptions or analysis_notes), use the YAML folded style with the >- operator to ensure proper formatting.
